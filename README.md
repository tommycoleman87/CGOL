## Project Overview

Conways Game of Life is a famous cellular automaton created by mathematician John Horton Conway. It is turing complete. Check here for more information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life

###  Key Features

-    Ability to select and deselect cells
-    Ability to start and pause the simulation
-    Unable to select a cell when the simulation is in process
-    Ability to speed up and slow down the simulation
-    Ability to select preset patterns

##  Tech Stack

This version of Conways Game of Life was built using vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. 

## Rules
-    Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
-    Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation
-    Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
-    Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.


    

## Installation
 Nothing special is needed to pull down and run this project, no external libraries where used.
